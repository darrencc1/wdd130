            It is essential that your passwords have numbers, upper and lowercase numbers, and special characters. 
            Go to haveibeenpwned.com and input your email address. If you scroll down you can see what companies and sites have
             had data breaches. It will even show what data of yours was potentially leaked. This could be passwords, phone numbers, 
             ip addresses and more. GO change your passwords! Use dedicated password manager comapanies and not your web based 
             password managers from google or other browsers. They do not have any reason to devote tons of effort into securing
              your passwords, however, companies where their entire bread and butter is managing your passwords, will be
              much safer and way more reliable.</p>
