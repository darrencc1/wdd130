            <p>Why is it so important to secure your home network? What are the risks if you do not?
                Why should you protect your internet? Securing your internet is like locking your doors at night and making sure you lock your car when 
                you park on the street. Each page of this website will dive deeper into defending your home from network from attacks and even how to 
                help prevent people from getting into your car or garage by copying your remote keys. There will be challenges on each page that you 
                can do RIGHT NOW to help secure your network

            <h3>What to do RIGHT now!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Look up your email on haveibeenpwned.com</li>
                <li>Get a password Manager</li>
                <li>Change your passwords w. the guidelines given to the right!</li>
                <li>Have a different password for everything, do NOT have the same password for your Bank account and your email!</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="content-2">
            <p>In the picture to the right you can see how secure your passwords are. 
               Remember that this changes over time and could be outdated already! 
               It is essential that your passwords have numbers, upper and lowercase numbers, and special characters. 
               Go to haveibeenpwned.com and input your email address. If you scroll down you can see what companies and sites have
               had data breaches. It will even show what data of yours was potentially leaked. This could be passwords, phone numbers, 
               ip addresses and more. GO change your passwords! Use dedicated password manager companies and not your web-based 
               password managers from Google or other browsers. They do not have any reason to devote tons of effort into securing
               your passwords, however, companies where their entire bread and butter is managing your passwords, will be
               much safer and way more reliable.
