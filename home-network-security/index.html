                Securing your home network is crucial in today's digital age due to the multitude of risks associated with unsecured connections. 
                Without proper security measures, your network becomes vulnerable to various cyber threats such as malware, phishing attacks, identity theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. 
                Just as you lock your doors at night to protect your home and ensure your car is secure when parked on the street, safeguarding your internet is essential to prevent intruders from exploiting vulnerabilities in your network.
                Think of securing your home network as a proactive measure to defend against potential threats rather than waiting for an attack to occur. 
                Each page of this website will delve deeper into strategies for defending your home network from attacks and provide practical tips.

                <li>Change your passwords w. the guidelines given to the right!</li>
                <li>Have a different password for everything, do NOT have the same password for your Bank account and your email!</li>

            <p>In the picture to the right you can see how secure your passwords are. 
               Remember that this changes over time and could be outdated already! 
               It is essential that your passwords have numbers, upper and lowercase numbers, and special characters. 
               Go to haveibeenpwned.com and input your email address. If you scroll down you can see what companies and sites have
               had data breaches. It will even show what data of yours was potentially leaked. This could be passwords, phone numbers, 
               ip addresses and more. GO change your passwords! Use dedicated password manager companies and not your web-based 
               password managers from Google or other browsers. They do not have any reason to devote tons of effort into securing
               your passwords, however, companies where their entire bread and butter is managing your passwords, will be
               much safer and way more reliable.
