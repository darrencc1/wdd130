    <p>There are many items that we hold in our hands and pockets daily. Your wallet, phone, car keys, maybe a company id card.
        These things are essential to have but it is very easy for someone to copy them. What do I mean? If you have your credit card in your wallet
        someone could just walk by and scan your card without you even realizing and potentially steal money from you. Think of a garage door opener,
        if you have an opener in your car, someone can walk up and just copy that frequency. Your door may be locked, but when someone can just open your garage
        door by stealing that frequency it really doesn't do much. This is also true fro remote car keys and almost everything that uses frequencies to open or unlock.
