      <h3>[Secure Your Home Today]</h3>
      <p>
        [Why is it so important to secure your home network?
        What are the risks if you do not?
        Why should you protect your internet?
        Securing your internet is like locking your doors at night and making sure you lock your car when you park on the street.
        Each page of this website will dive deeper into defending your home from network from attacks and even how to help prevent people from getting into your car or garage by copying your remote keys. 
        
        There will be challenges on each page that you can do RIGHT NOW to help secure your network
        In the picture to the right you can see how secure your passwords are. Remember that this changes over time and could be outdated already! It is essential that your passwords have numbers, upper and lowercase numbers, and special characters.
        Go to haveibeenpwned.com and input your email address. If you scroll down you can see what companies and sites have had data breaches. It will even show what data of yours was potentially leaked. This could be passwords, phone numbers, ip addresses and more. GO change your passwords!
        Use dedicated password manager comapanies and not your web based password managers from google or other browsers. They do not have any reason to devote tons of effort into securing your passwords, however, companies where their entire bread and butter is managing your passwords, will be much safer and way more reliable.
        
        1. Look up your email on haveibeenpwned.com
        2. Get a password Manager
        3. Change your passwords w. the guidlines given to the right!
        4. Have a different password for everything, do NOT have the same password for your Bank account and your email!

      <h3>[How to Secure your own HOME network]</h3>
      <p>
        [Today you can go to the store and find vacuums, mops, and everyday household items that connect to your network or are controlled by a remote. Every one of these items can be hacked, and pose a potential threat to your network and home. 
        Do you own a smart tv, xbox, a digital assistant like Alexa, baby monitors or more? Try to find everything in your home that connects to your WiFi. Don't forget your thermostat might be able to connect as well! So a problem with many of these IOTs or Internet of Things, is that they are not always updated and secured. 
        So they are a potential weak spot in your network. This is where network Segmentation comes in!
        
        Keeping your main network seperated from your Internet of Things (IOT) network helps keep you secure. If your smart tv is easy to get into, it creates a foothold for hackers to get into your network which can escalate into account credintials, bank accounts, even private information about you and your family.
        Go to your router, google it and see if you can create another network. Call it whatever you want, make sure the password for this network is different from your main network. Connect all IOT devices onto it and already you are that much more secure!
        
        Identify what is connecting to your internet that is not your phone or computer
        Look at your router and google how to set up another network on it.
        Create a seperate network, with a DIFFERENT password and put all IOT on it. (xbox, controllers etc.)
        Look into making another network for guests!]
